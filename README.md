[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/kangoka/tiktok-autoviewsv2-py)](https://repl.it/github/kangoka/tiktok-autoviewsv2-py)# Tik Tok Auto Views V2 and and the difference
**Tik Tok Auto Views V1 (previous project):**\
  Only get 200-1000 (options) views every 5 minutes (it's good thing and bad thing at the same time)\
  \
**Tik Tok Auto Views V2 (this one), you have 2 options:**
  1. You can get instant 5K views every 5 minutes (still, it's good thing and bad thing at the same time) or
  2. You can get random fans between 20-30 (I think) every 5 minutes
  
## Requirements
Python 3
  
## Install dependency
<pre>pip install selenium
pip install pyfiglet==0.7.5</pre>

## How to use
1. Download this repo
2. Make sure all dependencies installed
3. Open tiktodv2.py using Code Editor and edit line
<pre>vidUrl = "YOUR_URL" #Change YOUR_URL to your Tik Tok video URL
username = "YOUR_USERNAME" #Change YOUR_USERNAME to your Tik Tok username
auto = 2 #Change 2 for Tik Tok views</pre>
4. python tiktodv2.py
5. **You still have to manual complete gcaptcha check (only for first time you run the code)**

## Tips
Use RDP to get tons of views or fans (run 24/7)
